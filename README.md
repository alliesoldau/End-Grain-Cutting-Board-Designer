# End Grain Cutting Board Generator

[Site Link](https://alliesoldau.github.io/Sandbox/index.html)

My fiance and I enjoy designing and building end grain cutting boards. The most frustrating part of the process has always been purchasing the right amount (and dimensions) of lumber to create what we want while limiting waste.

This site helps wood workers to design checker pattern end grain cutting boards, and then recommends exactly how much lumber to purchase per wood type, accounting for kerf, so that builders can feel confident heading into the lumber mill for their projects.

I built this all in vanilla javascript and am hosting it on GitHub.
